# Drone-path-computing
Computing optimal and suboptimal paths for a drone in  a 3D environment using AI algorithms on a grid and a graph

This was done as part of a school project for my AI class at the City University of Hong Kong (CityU), my work can be found in the 
planning_utils.py file where all the algorithms have been writte by me.
